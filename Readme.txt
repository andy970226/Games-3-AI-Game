Most time if you don't use teleport trap properly you would lose or get a tie game. 

The cubes left is just teleport traps number indicator.

You are the pink agent and AI is blue.

HTN graph as pdf shown.

Still have some tricks (or bugs) to win, like you use a trap to respawn an enemy when AI is at the enemy respawn area and AI probabably die immediately. 

The AI is not kinematic thus you can hardly obstruct it.
